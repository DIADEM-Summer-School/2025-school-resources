# Diamond Summer School - Paris 2025

**Introduction to Machine Learning Technics in Python**

This class will be done with the use of a series of Colab Notebooks. 
Please remember that the alterations you do in the notebook there **are not permanent** unless you save a copy of the notebook in your personal drive or download it.

Try to take your time on the activities, be free to skip some of the open questions if you are having truble following the rest of the group. 
The objective is to get acquainted with the tools, not to master them. The martery will come with time and practice!
